# Discord Link Checker Bot

This Discord bot, designed for personal and community use, enhances server security by scrutinizing links shared within Discord channels. It leverages the VirusTotal API, WHOIS lookups, and urlscan.io scans to provide comprehensive real-time analysis, helping maintain a safe online environment for members.

## Features

- **Real-time Link Analysis**: Automatically checks links shared in Discord against the VirusTotal database, performs WHOIS lookups, and submits URLs to urlscan.io for scanning.
- **Comprehensive Security Reports**: Generates detailed reports including VirusTotal's analysis, domain registration details from WHOIS, and web page snapshots and security insights from urlscan.io.
- **Flexible Checking Modes**: Offers both a concise overview (Simple Mode) and detailed reports (Detailed Mode) to suit different user preferences.
- **Ease of use**: The bot will embed a screenshot of the link sent for checking right in the chat in both scanning modes, simple or detailed.

## Getting Started

Before you can use the bot, you'll need to set it up with your Discord server and configure it with your API keys.

### Prerequisites

- A Discord account with administrative privileges on your server.
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- API keys for VirusTotal and urlscan.io (available from their respective websites).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `config.py` file in the same directory as your bot script, and add your Discord Bot Token, VirusTotal API Key, urlscan.io API Key, and guild ID(s) in the following format:

```python
TOKEN = 'your_discord_bot_token_here'
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key_here'
URLSCAN_API_KEY = 'your_urlscan_io_api_key_here'
guild_ids = [your_guild_id_here]
```
4. Run `main.py`

## Dependencies

This bot requires the following Python packages:
- discord.py
- requests
- python-whois

## Future Enhancements

- **Modular Codebase**: Refactor the bot's codebase to split functionalities into individual modules, making the code easier to maintain and extend. This modular approach will facilitate adding new features and integrations seamlessly.
- **Configurable Settings**: Introduce bot settings that server administrators can customize, such as enabling or disabling certain features and scanning modes. This flexibility will allow admins to tailor the bot's functionality to their server's specific needs and preferences.
- **Dashboard Integration**: Develop a web-based dashboard that provides an overview of past scans, including detailed results and statistics. This dashboard will offer insights into the types of links shared within the server and the bot's effectiveness in identifying threats, enhancing transparency and trust in the bot's capabilities.
- **Additional Scanning Integrations**: Expand the bot's scanning capabilities by integrating additional security tools and services. This expansion will provide more comprehensive coverage and protection against a wider range of online threats.
- **User Feedback System**: Implement a system for users to provide feedback on scan results, such as reporting false positives or missed threats. This feedback loop will help improve the bot's accuracy and effectiveness over time.
